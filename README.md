# Touch Typing App

An app to practice your keyboard skills!

## What is Touch Typing?
Touch typing is typing without looking at the keyboard. The fundamental idea is that each finger is given its own section of the keyboard and your fingers learn the location of the keyboard through practising regularly and gaining muscle memory to eventually build up speed whilst typing. While touch typing is a practice of keys, words & sentences. In this app, weâ€™ll focus only on keys practice & only on the 8 keys of the keyboard (asdfjkl;)

## Run the App

Download or clone the repositiry. Run `npm install` to install all ependencies, then run `npm start` to run the app in development mode.

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm install`

Install all dependencies.

### `npm start`

After installing of all dependencies, run `npm start` in the terminal to run start the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
